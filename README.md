Hi there, Thank you giving me an opportunity to take an assessment with Zepz.
This was fun!

### How to run the app ?

If you wish to run the tests, run:
`npm run test`

This was a fun small project to work on and I am grateful for the opportunity.

Note: Building this app took me about 6-8 hours, mainly because I was not 100% well
health wise and decided to use tools that I am not very familiar with just for the fun
of playing around with new tools.
